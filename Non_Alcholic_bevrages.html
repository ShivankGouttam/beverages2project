	A non-alcoholic drink is one that contains little or no alcohol.
	 This category includes low-alcohol beer, non-alcoholic wine, and apple cider if they contain a 
	 sufficiently low concentration of alcohol by volume (ABV). 
	 The exact definition of what is "non-alcoholic" and what is not depends on local laws: <br>
	 in the United Kingdom, "alcohol-free beer" is under 0.05% ABV, "de-alcoholised beer" is under 0.5%, while "low-alcohol beer" can contain no more than 1.2% ABV.
	 <br>The term "soft drink" specifies the absence of alcohol in contrast to "hard drink" and "drink". The term "drink" is theoretically neutral, but often is used in a way that suggests alcoholic content. Drinks such as soda pop, sparkling water, iced tea, lemonade, root beer, fruit punch, milk, hot chocolate, tea, coffee, milkshakes, tap water, bottled water, juice and energy drinks are all soft drinks.<br>
