	Fruit juice is a natural product that contains few or no additives. Citrus products such as 
	orange juice and tangerine juice are familiar
	 breakfast drinks, while grapefruit juice, pineapple, apple, grape, lime, and lemon juice are also common. 
	 Coconut water is a highly nutritious and refreshing juice.<br> 
	Many kinds of berries are crushed; their juices are mixed with water and sometimes sweetened.
	 Raspberry, blackberry and currants are popular juices drinks but the percentage of water also 
	 determines their nutritive value. Grape juice allowed to ferment produces wine.<br>

Fruits are highly perishable so the ability to extract juices and store them was of significant value. Some fruits are highly acidic and mixing them with water and sugars or honey was often necessary to make them palatable. Fruits can also be blended with ice and other ingredients to make a smoothie. Early storage of fruit juices was labor-intensive, requiring the crushing of the fruits and the mixing of the resulting pure juices with sugars before bottling.
